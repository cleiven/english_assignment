    <h1> The AI Ethics Debate: Introduction</h1>

    <p>In recent years, AI has become much more powerful and useful than ever before, but not without controversy. Creating Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT requires gigantic resevoirs of text- everything from chatroom logs to library books.</p>
    <p>Is this use ethical, or have companies like OpenAI stolen everything every written to build an industrial plagiarism machine?</p>
    <h2>Positions</h2>

    <h2 class="item">[1]: Using copyrighted data to train Large Language Models (LLMs) is unethical</h1>
      <p> This perspective argues that using copyrighted training data is equivalent to republishing copyrighted work without permission</p>
    <h2 class="item">[2]: Using copyrighted data to training LLMs is fair use</h1>
      <p> This perspective argues that training LLMs with copyrighted data is not unethical because it's transformative, equivalent to a human learning and reciting information in their original work.</p>
