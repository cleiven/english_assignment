    <h1> The AI Ethics Debate: Introduction</h1>
    
    <h2>What you need to know</h2>

    <p>In recent years, AI has become much more powerful and useful than ever before, but not without controversy. Creating Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT requires gigantic reservoirs of text- everything from chatroom logs to library books.
      Is this use ethical, or have companies like OpenAI stolen everything every written to build an industrial plagiarism machine? 
      Let's explore what stakeholders in the issue have to say.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Positions</h2>

    <h2 class="item">[1]: Using copyrighted data to train LLMs is unethical</h1>
      <p> This perspective, common among creative people whose work AI attempts to imitate,
        argues that using copyrighted training data is equivalent to 
        republishing copyrighted work without permission.</p>
    <h2 class="item">[2]: Using copyrighted data to training LLMs is fair use</h1>
      <p> This perspective, common among AI developers and enthusiasts  argues that training LLMs with copyrighted data is not unethical because it's transformative, equivalent to a human learning and reciting information in their original work.</p>

    <p>
      This opinion paper from the International Journal of Information Management explores the various ethical promises and concerns of ChatGPT:
      both what it can do to benefit society, and what it might do to harm it. It gives a detailed synopsis of the ethics of LLMs, providing a
      theoretical background in the field of ethics as relevant to ChatGPT and other generative AI models.

    <p>
      This paper for the peer-reviewed journal <i>Electronics</i> explores ethical concerns about ChatGPT with regards to
      privacy, bias, and abuse. This paper provides a brief explanation of what ChatGPT is, how it works, and what it can do,
      and how it's been transforming the public consciousness in recent years. It then enumerates a number of ethical problems
      with the content ChatGPT produces, such as its bias against Muslims or its potential for generating fake news indistinguishable
      from real reporting.
