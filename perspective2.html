    <h1> Generative AI is Not Unethical</h1>
    <p>In other people's opinions, chiefly those of people in the AI industry, using copyrighted data to train AI is not unethical. One such opinion comes from
      Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman, who argues in
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPvqvt55l3A&t=865s">an interview with NBC news</a>
      that using data from the internet to train AI is ethical because, according to him, there is a long-standing, implicit
       social contract which makes all content on the web free and open to reuse and remix for any purpose. He's basically arguing
       that the web is a gigantic open-source database of knowledge, intended for the benefit of anyone who accesses it. Unlike
       Robyn Speer, Suleyman would likely say that there is no difference between scraping a website to count word frequencies and scraping a website to train
       train Copilot: both are legitimate uses of humanity's geocache of knowledge.
    <p></p>

    <p>
      A congruent opinion came from Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, when he <a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/01/09/impossible-openai-admits-chatgpt-cant-exist-without-pinching-copyrighted-work/">told the British parliament</a> that ChatGPT would be "impossible"
      to create without using copyrighted data, and that training AI does not infringe on copyright laws. Altman is basically saying that such a useful
      technology as ChatGPT, when its existence comes into conflict with copyright laws, should be allowed to exist, implying that its utility and potential
      outweigh its potential copyright infringement.
